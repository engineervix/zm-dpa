# Contribution guide

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

When contributing to [this project](https://github.com/engineervix/zm-dpa), if you would like to make a non-trivial contribution, please first create an [issue](https://github.com/engineervix/zm-dpa/issues) to discuss the change you wish to make before making the change (No need to do this if you are fixing a bug or typos, etc.).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome 😊.
