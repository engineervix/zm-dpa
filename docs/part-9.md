# Part 9 » Rights of the Data Subject

## 58. Right of access and notification

1.  A data subject has the right to obtain from the data
    controller, confirmation as to whether or not personal data
    concerning that data subject is being processed.

2.  A data subject may, where that data subject’s personal data is being
    processed, access in a manner that the data subject understands the
    following information:

    1.  the purpose of the processing, the category of data the
        processing relates to, and the categories of recipients the data
        is disclosed to;
    2.  envisaged period for which the personal data shall be stored,
        where possible or if not possible, the criteria used to
        determine that period;
    3.  data being processed, as well as the source of that data; and
    4.  information about the basic logic involved in any automatic
        processing of data relating to the data in case of automated
        decision making.

3.  A data subject has the right to notification of all third parties to
    whom that data subject’s personal data has been disclosed and the
    measures put in place to safeguard personal information of that data
    subject.
4.  A data subject shall access that data subject’s personal data in
    accordance with the relevant written law relating to access to
    information.
5.  Where sensitive personal data is processed for the purpose of
    scientific research, informing the data subject may be postponed
    until the research is concluded, if —

    1.  informing the data subject would significantly prejudice the
        research;
    2.  there is no evident risk of infringement of the data subject’s
        right to protection of the data subject’s privacy; and
    3.  the data was collected initially on the basis of consent.

6.  A data controller may provide a copy of the personal data undergoing
    processing at no cost for the initial data and at a reasonable fee
    based on administrative costs for additional copies of the data.
7.  Where the data subject makes a data request by electronic means, and
    unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information
    shall be provided in a commonly used electronic format.
8.  The right to obtain a copy of personal data under subsection (5)
    shall not be enforced where that enforcement prejudices the rights
    and freedoms of others.

## 59. Right to rectification

1.  The data subject has the right to, rectification of inaccurate
    personal data concerning the data subject as soon as practicable.
2.  A data subject shall taking into account the purposes of the
    processing, have the right to have incomplete personal data completed.

## 60. Right to erasure

1.  The data subject has the right to erasure of personal data of
    that data subject as soon as practicable and the data controller
    shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
    where the —

    1.  personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes
        for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
    2.  data subject, or a person holding parental responsibility, where
        the data subject is a child, withdraws consent and there is no
        other legal ground for the processing;
    3.  data subject objects to the processing and there are no
        overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data
        subject objects to the processing unless the data controller is
        otherwise permitted by the provisions of this Act;
    4.  personal data has been unlawfully processed; or
    5.  personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal
        obligation in the Republic to which the data controller is
        subject.

2.  A data controller shall, where the data controller has made the
    personal data public, take all reasonable steps to inform a data
    processor and third party processing that data by virtue of that
    publication, that the data subject has requested the erasure of any
    links to, or copy or replication of, that personal data.

## 61. Right of objection

1.  Subject to this Act, a data subject may object, to processing
    of that data subject’s personal data.
2.  A data controller shall not, where a data subject objects to the
    processing of that data subject’s personal data, process the
    personal data objected to under subsection (1) unless the data
    controller is permitted by the provisions of any other written law.
3.  A data subject may, where personal data is processed for direct
    marketing purposes, object to processing of that data subject’s
    personal data.
4.  Where a data subject objects to the processing of personal data for
    direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be
    processed for that purpose but may be processed for any other lawful
    purpose.
5.  A data controller shall on the first communication with the data
    subject, expressly bring the rights of the data subject to the
    attention of the data subject and present the information clearly
    and separately from any other information.

## 62. Decision taken on basis of automatic data processing

1.  A data subject shall not be subject to a decision based solely
    on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal
    effects concerning that data subject or similarly affects that data
    subject.
2.  Subsection (1) shall not apply if the decision is —

    1.  necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract
        between the data subject and a data controller;
    2.  authorised by any written law; or
    3.  based on the data subject’s explicit consent.

3.  A data controller shall, in cases under subsection (2), implement
    suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and
    freedoms and legitimate interests, including the right to obtain
    human intervention on the part of the data controller for purposes
    of enabling the data subject to express the data subject’s point of
    view and contest the decision.
4.  Automated data processing shall not be undertaken where the
    processing involves sensitive personal data unless —

    1.  the data subject has expressly consented to that processing;

    2.  the processing is in the public interest; or

    3.  the processing is permitted by any written law and suitable
        measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and
        legitimate interests are in place.

## 63. Right to restriction of processing

1.  A data subject may restrict a data controller from processing
    that data subject’s personal data where the—

    1.  accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject,
        for a period enabling the data controller to verify the accuracy
        of the personal data;
    2.  data controller no longer needs the personal data for the
        purposes of the processing, but it is required by the data
        subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
        claims;
    3.  data subject has objected to processing pursuant to section
        60(1)*\(c)* pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of
        the data controller override those of the data subject.

2.  Where processing has been restricted under subsection (1), that
    personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be
    processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment,
    exercise or defence of legal claims or for reasons of important
    public interest or where the law compels that processing.
3.  A data subject who has obtained a restriction on the processing of
    that data subject’s personal data pursuant to subsection (1) shall be
    informed by the data controller before the restriction
    of processing that data is lifted.

## 64. Information when personal data collected directly from data subject

A data controller shall where personal data relating to the data
subject is collected directly from the data subject, concurrently

        data relating to that data subject;
    </li>
    <li>
        where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to
        transfer personal data to a third country or international

                specific circumstances in which the data is collected, is
                not necessary to guarantee accurate processing.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

## 65. Right to data portability
